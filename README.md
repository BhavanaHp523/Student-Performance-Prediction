# Student-Performance-Prediction
# Student Performance Analysis & Prediction System

## Project Overview

This project analyzes student academic data and predicts the final exam score using Machine Learning.
Users can enter attendance, study hours, and previous score through a web interface to get predicted final marks.

## Technologies Used

* MySQL (Database)
* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Machine Learning (Scikit-learn – Linear Regression)
* Flask (Web Framework)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)

## Features

* Student data stored in MySQL database
* Data analysis & visualization graphs
* Correlation heatmap
* Machine learning prediction model
* Web application for real-time prediction

## Machine Learning Model

Algorithm: Linear Regression
Inputs:

* Attendance
* Study Hours
* Previous Score

Output:

* Predicted Final Score

## How to Run Project

### 1. Database

Import `student_analysis.sql` into MySQL

### 2. Run Notebook

Open `student_analysis.ipynb` and execute all cells

### 3. Run Web App

Go to webapp folder and run:

python app.py

Open browser:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Output
